# Gix Components

Gix Components is a UI kit developed with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) by the Gix team.

## Getting Started

The component library is in active development, and new features will incrementally be available.

Its documentation is constantly improved and deployed on the IC: [https://ipi2f-uqaaa-aaaad-aabza-cai.ic0.app/](https://ipi2f-uqaaa-aaaad-aabza-cai.ic0.app/)

## Installation

Install `gix-components` as a dependency.

```bash
npm i @dfinity/gix-components
```

## Packaging

Running `npm run package` takes the contents of `src/lib` and generate the `package` directory - i.e. the library that is published to npm.

See [documentation](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/packaging) for more information.

## Documentation & Showcase

To run the documentation locally, `npm run dev` can be executed.

Running `npm run build` will bundle this showcase. It should be executed before deploying the documentation to a canister smart contract.

Note: all pages of the application are set to be pre-rendered per default.
